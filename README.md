# Winning-solution-DataFestAfrica22-Datathon

I and my teammates participated in the DataFest Africa 2022 Datathon and We came out as the winners of the Competition. I played the role of a data analyst in this competition. 

In the final stage of the competition, I worked as a data analyst for Zentel Network service Center, a telecommunication center that needed help to optimize their Ticketing performance. By paying strict attention to the Stakeholders needs, my team mates used 5W's & H approach to tackle this problem and proffer a solution to the company.

Skills I used for this competition: Data Gathering, Data Assessing, Data Cleaning, Data Exploration (Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Dashboarding and Reporting, Data Storytelling.
